    <p id="edit_crown_des">
        The Crown's history and reputation has given it prominence in the Toyota lineup, as it is one of the few current Toyota models to carry its own unique insignia for the model line with the current Crown having a stylized crown emblem on the grille and steering wheel along with inspiring the names of its smaller progenitors. The Corona, introduced as a smaller companion to the Crown means "crown" in Latin and was initially exported as the "Tiara", while the Corolla took its name from the corolla ("small crown") in Latin. The Camry's name is derived from the Japanese phrase kanmuri (冠, かんむり) meaning "little crown" and the Toyota Scepter took its name from the sceptre, an accessory to a crown. The Avalon (the Crown's North American counterpart), while not named after a crown, is named after a mythical island from the legends of King Arthur.

        <p id="edit_mazda_des">
            Beginning in the 1960s, Mazda was inspired by the NSU Ro 80 and decided to put a major engineering effort into development of the Wankel rotary engine as a way of differentiating itself from other Japanese auto companies. The company formed a business relationship with German company NSU and began with the limited-production Cosmo Sport of 1967, and continuing to the present day with the Pro Mazda Championship, Mazda has become the sole manufacturer of Wankel-type engines for the automotive market, mainly by way of attrition (NSU and Citroën both gave up on the design during the 1970s, and prototype Corvette efforts by General Motors never made it to production.)

        <P id="edit_honda_des">
            Honda, after establishing itself as a leading manufacturer of motorcycles during the 1950s, began production of automobiles in 1963.[8] Honda introduced its N360 minicar, compliant with Kei car specifications for the Japanese market, for the 1967 model year. The car had a transverse-mounted front engine, front-wheel drive (FF) layout, which would be adopted for the later N600 (1969), H1300 (1970) and Civic (1972) models.[9] Occupying a size niche between minicars and compact sedans, the Civic offered a combination of economy and practicality with its space-efficient design that had immediate appeal. The Civic gave Honda their first market success competing with manufacturers of standard compact car

        <p id="edit_nissan_des">
            The Nissan X-Trail (Japanese: 日産・エクストレイル, Nissan Ekusutoreiru) is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan since 2000.The main production plant of the X-Trail is in Kanda, Fukuoka, Japan. Parts and engines that are produced in Japan are also assembled by other Nissan plants in numerous countries.  .It was one of Nissan's first crossover SUV and was released about the same time as several other companies' competing car-based crossovers. At its introduction, the X-Trail is erged with the Rogue, making them virtually identical. The Rogue nameplate is mainly used in North America. For the first time, the vehicle is offered with three-row seating as an option. It also marked a departure in terms of design from a rugged boxy look to an urban-oriented crossover SUV design.
